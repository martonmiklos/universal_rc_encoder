# Universal R/C encoder

This repo hosts the CAD files of the Universal R/C encoder circuit drawn in EAGLE. 

Firmware can be found [here](https://github.com/martonmiklos/universal_rc_encoder_fw)

The goal of this project to provide an "addon" PCB which is capable of emulating various R/C toy encoder ICs.
 * TX2/RX2
 * Nikko C1069C
 * TAIYO ??
 * Standard PPM for backward compatiblity

The PCB is based on the 3rd USD STM8S003F3 and it is shaped to be able to installed in the place of an NE5044 encoder.
